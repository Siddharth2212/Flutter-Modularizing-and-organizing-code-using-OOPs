# Modularizing and organizing code using OOPs

## Goal

In this tutorial I will be reviewing Stateful and Stateless Widgets as well as learning about the fundamental building blocks of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - Classes and Objects. 


## What I will create

I'm going to make a quiz app that tests your general knowledge. As one of the most popular types of apps on the app stores, I can create my own quiz for other people to enjoy!

## What I learnt

- Modularising your code into separate classes.
- Dart classes and objects.
- Using class constructors.
- Extracting Widgets to refactor your code.
- private and public modifiers in Dart.
- How to use Dart lists.
- The difference between var, const and final.
